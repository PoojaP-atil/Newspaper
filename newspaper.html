Further, his lawyers had contended in the High Court that the project was functional and the claim that public money was misappropriated did not have any basis.His lawyers had argued that the alleged offences relate to policy decisions approved by the State Cabinet and cannot be the subject of criminal proceedings. The ₹360 crore allotment for the skill development project was included in the 2015-16 Budget.

The Indian seamers were unable to keep the pressure on as they bowled a bit too short and allowed the Aussie batters to free their arms. The rain break allowed the hosts to regroup and assess their plans, which they indeed did. Post-resumption, Ravichandran Ashwin was given the ball from one end, and with his guile and deception, he dismantled the Australian middle order. His spin partner, Ravindra Jadeja, got into the wicket-taking act and used the favourable conditions to his advantage to pile more misery on Australia. Towards the end, complacency crept in with a few lapses in the field which allowed the tail to wag.
